## Restaurant Recommendation System

<!--
Discuss: Value proposition: Your will propose a machine learning system that can be
used in an existing business or service. (You should not propose a system in which
a new business or service would be developed around the machine learning system.)
Describe the value proposition for the machine learning system. What’s the (non-ML)
status quo used in the business or service? What business metric are you going to be
judged on? (Note that the “service” does not have to be for general users; you can
propose a system for a science problem, for example.)
